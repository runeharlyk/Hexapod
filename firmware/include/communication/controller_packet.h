 * radio, so a fixed channel on both ends breaks the moment the robot joins a
 * router. The robot cannot tell the controller to move -- the controller would
 * have to already be listening on the robot's channel to hear that -- so the
 * discovery runs the other way: the robot announces, the controller hunts.
